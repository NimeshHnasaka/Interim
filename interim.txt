This method worked well for getting information about preferences, past experiences with the circumstances and history of restaurant processes, and future improvements they would like to see to streamline the process.




Analysis 2.1 Methods of Collecting Information


Details Several ways are used to comprehend the current envi
ronment and challenges in order to gather information on automatic self-service and food detection processes. These techniques are some of the more successful ones.


existing systems 

Using Computer Vision to Identify Food:

The goal of research is to create models and algorithms that can reliably identify and detect different kinds of food. In order to interpret photos and identify various food products, deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used.
The use of deep learning techniques to identify food products kept in a refrigerator was investigated in a paper named "Food Recognition and Detection for Smart Refrigerator Applications" (Li et al., 2017). The system was designed to help users keep track of food inventories and expiration dates.
A different study, "Food Image Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network" (Yu et al., 2019), suggested using CNN to identify and categorize food photos that were taken with smartphones. It is possible that the system will be coupled with inventory management or meal ordering systems.




Food Service Automation:

This field of study focuses on automating order taking, preparation, and billing, among other areas of food service. The goals of automation are to increase productivity, decrease human error, and streamline procedures.
A touchscreen kiosk-based system for automating the ordering and billing procedure in fast-food restaurants was presented in "Automated Ordering and Billing System for Fast Food Chains" (Kumar et al., 2018). Without assistance from a human, customers can place orders and make payments.
Researchers created a robotic system that can prepare meals on its own in a study titled "Robotic Kitchen: A Fully Automated Robotic Kitchen Assistant for Assisted Meal Preparation" (Birk et al., 2020). To perform a variety of cooking chores, the device combined robotic manipulation with food detecting skills.
