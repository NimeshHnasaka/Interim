In this research, I have developed an object detection model specifically tailored for Sri Lankan food item image identification and billing system software. The initial step involved gathering a comprehensive dataset of 6000 food item images from Restaurants.  

In this study, I created an object detection model specifically for the Sri Lankan food item identification and billing system software. I collected a dataset of 6000 food item photos from restaurants and tested multiple CNN models for object detection, ultimately picking one with an operational speed of 48ms. This approach was linked into a billing platform, which made restaurant operations more efficient. In Sri Lanka, the software is the first of its kind that can identify individual food products as well as duplicated items.

The presented automatic machine cashier, which uses object detection, demonstrates a proof-of-concept for computing retail product pricing using computer vision algorithms rather than traditional methods such as barcode scanning, RFID, or manual price calculation by operators. 

This technique brings up new opportunities for improving productivity and decreasing human error in checkout systems. 

This research makes a substantial contribution to the integration of the CNN model into the billing application, which improves efficiency and accuracy in detecting food products while also providing a solution for Queues in restaurant.

Future research should focus on improving the accuracy of item detection algorithms and expanding the dataset to include a broader range of food kinds.
